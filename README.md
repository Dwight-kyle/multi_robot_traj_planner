# Multi-robot Trajectory Planner

This repository contains the code for the paper:

Efficient Trajectory Planning for Multiple Non-holonomic Mobile Robots via Prioritized Trajectory Optimization

**Authors:** Juncheng Li, Maopeng Ran, and Lihua Xie from Nanyang Technological University.

This paper proposes an efficient trajectory planning approach that generates safe, dynamically feasible and near-optimal trajectories
for multiple non-holonomic mobile robots in obstacle-rich environments.
